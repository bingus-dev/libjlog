libjlog v1.1.3 release notes
======================
libjlog is a simple-to-use standarized output
system for low-level software like custom operating
systems and C-based memory-efficient systems.

It is configurable and easy-to-use for both C and C++.

Configure
======================
Copy "libjlog.c" and "libjlog.h" into your project.
While booting into your system, initialize libjlog with
this code:

        libjlog_init(printing_fn, "OSName")

libjlog requires printing_fn as a callback. Here is an
example:

        void printing_fn(char *text) {
            // do stuff here to output *text !
        }

You can find examples to use for your code in the /examples
directory.

To test libjlog, you can set libjcli.config.h's printing function
and use the included CLI tool (run make).

You should be good from here.
